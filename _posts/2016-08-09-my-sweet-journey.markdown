Sometimes life has a way of forcing you to adapt or face the concequences. I had just gotten hitched in Sept. 2014 I was still working at a huge company in a very little job so I decided for the sake of my budding family I would expand my skills. So I began learning to code at Codecademy it was alot of fun and almost reminded me of when I was a kid sitting in front of my Commodore 64.

Then the most happy surprise. My first born son was on his way! My wife found out an entire month later(yeah...we're quick starters) so I ramped it up, learning how to develop with Wordpress so I could freelance building websites to earn extra money. Well this completely increased my appetite to learn more so I decided to attempted to learn how to build games using Unity. Nothing big just a simple platformer so I can use it as ad fodder.

This introduced me to C#, I picked the language because I wanted to learn something different than JavaScript at the time. Also I was really interested in how C languages worked, I read about C and object oriented programming(OOP) in high school but never really explored syntax or app building because people named LaDarius just didn't code but that's a different blog post for another time. My choice in language was a great one because it introduced be to the .NET framework and all of the cool stuff you can build with it.

I absolutely loved programming using Visual Studio but when I found out about the ASP aspect of C# I was even more intrigued about what I could do with programming using the language. Finding out about enumerators and interfaces, really digging into building classes, also whether to use Web Forms or MVC to create a web application. The fact I even knew that there was a such thing as a web application was huge, I didn't even realize that was a thing! and it was the coolest thing ever.

So now I am a full on programmer to say the least, I'm learning more about solving problems in code I watched as many Xamarin Evolve sessions as I possibly could in between working, raising my kids, and loving my wife. I'm an enthusiast and a fanboy, and I am loving every minute of the journey!
